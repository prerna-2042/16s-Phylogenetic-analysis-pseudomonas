# 16s rRNA-Phylogenetic-analysis-Pseudomonas aeruginosa

## Project Overview
This project presents a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* using MEGA X software.
This is my first bioinformatics project, focusing on molecular evolution and phylogenetic tree construction.

---

## Objectives
- Retrieve 16S rRNA gene sequences
- Perform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
- Construct phylogenetic tree
- Interpret evolutionary relationships

---

## Tools Used
- NCBI (Sequence retrieval)
- MEGA X
- FASTA format sequences

---

## Methodology
1. Downloaded 16S rRNA sequences from NCBI.
2. Performed alignment using MEGA X (ClustalW).
3. Constructed phylogenetic tree using Neighbor-Joining method.
4. Bootstrap analysis for tree confidence.

---

## Results
- Successfully generated phylogenetic tree.
- Observed clustering of closely related strains.
- Bootstrap values support evolutionary relationships.
